      About
      <p>Hello and welcome! I'm Saif. <br />
I come equipped with 8 years of IT expertise, fueled by a love for coding that traces back to my Game Development studies at University. This passion has seamlessly woven through various IT roles, where scripting became a natural extension. With a flair for creative hobbies such as pottery, sketching, and crafting intuitive and visually striking GUIs, each new project in my Web Development journey has been deeply fulfilling.
